# (URGENT) YING BUG, Cant enter in Stone Keep competitive 
Today i was playing competitive, 160789866 and a character using ying was bot, but he was talking with us in the character selection.

After 2 games, i choose ying for playing competitive 160807858 and the map was the same, Stone Keep. And the game disconnect me, I tried to reset the game like 5 times but I only could see the loading for Stone Keep and never could enter. The game after loading, always returns me to the lobby.

I think this could be a bug.
